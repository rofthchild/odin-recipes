# odin-recipes
This project is a basic recipe website. The purpose is to build my HTML/CSS chops (so to speak). 
    At first I will apply the HTML knowledge I have acquired working my way through about 44% of The Odin Project's "Foundations Course" (https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations).
    
    I will revisit this project after creating a brutalist web design to style it up with some CSS.

    -GOOD TIMES!
